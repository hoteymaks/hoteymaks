Originally, I wanted to be a teacher, but moved into software development to follow the passion I grew up with. The first steps that I took as an indie game developer allowed me to acquire good qualities as a software developer, a team leader, a patient tutor and the head of a small developer team. In 2020, I created a tooltip app for my needs, which to this day brings joy and relief to many designers around the world. 'Digital Elimai' Android app have found its recognition in the Kazakhstan's Ministry of Culture and republician news sources.
