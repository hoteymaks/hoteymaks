Originally, I wanted to be a teacher, but moved into software development to follow the passion I grew up with. The first steps that I took as an indie game developer allowed me to acquire good qualities as a software developer, a team leader and the head of a small developer team. In 2020, I created a tooltip app for my needs, which to this day brings joy and relief to many designers around the world.
